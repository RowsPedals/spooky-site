                        This about isn't dedicated to me but the process of making this site over the month. I knew I would have many ambitions that may not be done by submission time (including easter egg ideas ;-; ) but as I'm writing this on the last day I feel satisfied with turning this in even if I dont have a site deserving of a reward. I've learned how to add classes effectively (the js was <i>painfully</i> difficult to manage before a much needed trim of unnecessary code) and how to ask better questions in general to find answers to what I'm wondering. I think besides the technical features I've done a lot of personal growth in being able to sit at my computer for longer times and not feel like procrastinating for days on end afterward. <b>And turns out I've got 7 more days to work on this site so THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A DAILY CHANGE LOG!</b>

                <p>~ 5pm<br> <b>Is this how it ends?</b> <br> Well I started this project with a prize in mind but I end finding that I got something more precious, the expirience. This month I set a deadline that I was initially not gonna hit, but thanks to a random chance of 7 more days to complete my project I pushed myself to get a final product I could be proud of. I put much time effort and care into making this site my own and no one else could just do that for me</p>
